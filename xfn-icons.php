Plugin Name: XFN Icons
Plugin URI: http://dunvegan.ath.cx/blogs/sam/2008/04/05/xfn-links/
Description: Adds Icons after links according to wether you've specified XFN or not. XFN (XHTML Friends Network) is a way of adding properties to links to specify relationships between the two sites, or the two subjects of the sites. Wordpress supports them by default, and you can add them by looking further down the page on the "Add Links" Page in the Admin Area.
