Adds Icons after links according to whether you've specified XFN or not. 

== Description ==

Adds Icons after links according to whether you've specified XFN or not. XFN (XHTML Friends Network) is a way of adding properties to links to specify relationships between the two sites, or the two subjects of the sites. Wordpress supports them by default, and you can add them by looking further down the page on the "Add Links" Page in the Admin Area.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Make Sure you have some XFN relationships specified
1. View Your Blogroll.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is It Really That Simple? =

Yes. Yes it is. That's all that is needed. Everything else is already implemented in Wordpress by default.

= Does It Work With Wordpress MU? =

Yes. It is too simple not to.

= What if I Change My Theme? =

The PHP calls  for a simple stylesheet to be added to the main page. All that is in this stylesheet is markup for icons to be added after the links. Nothing else.

= I Just Installed it but the Icons aren't showing up =

Refresh you page, and perhaps clear your cache and refresh again. Don't worry, even I fell into this trap.
